# Gameplay Philosophy

Threadbound is built on three pillars:

1. **Thread = Identity**  
   Your chosen/absorbed colors define movement, combat, and story reactions. No two playthroughs feel the same.

2. **Choice Matters**  
   Sparing or absorbing a Thread Master permanently changes the world, NPCs, final area layout, and ending. No “optimal” path — every choice has narrative + mechanical weight.

3. **Flow-State Traversal**  
   Movement is joyful and expressive. Each color feels completely different (Red = momentum brute-force, Blue = graceful chaining, Yellow = reality-bending creativity).

Influences: Hollow Knight (exploration/combat depth), Celeste (tight movement), Dead Cells (replayability via builds), Undertale (choice consequences).
