# Endings – Full List (10 Total)

Every ending is determined by:
- Your starting color
- Which Thread Masters you absorbed or spared
- (If you went extreme) your final choice at the Reclaimer Warden

### 1–3. True Color Endings – Succession (Absorb only your own color, spare the other two)
You become the new embodiment of that thread. The Weaver is defeated, the Loom is reshaped to your philosophy.

| Ending Name          | Requirement                              | Final Palette          | Cinematic Summary |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------|
| True Red – The Monarch Reborn | Start Red + absorb only Monarch | Pure saturated crimson | You seat yourself on a throne of burning threads. The world is ordered through strength and fear. “Power endures.” |
| True Blue – The Hermit Eternal | Start Blue + absorb only Hermit | Pure saturated blue    | You retreat to an endless calm ocean of silk. The world finds peace in isolation. “Balance is solitude.” |
| True Yellow – The Sage Ascended | Start Yellow + absorb only Sage | Pure saturated gold    | You dissolve into infinite light and illusion. The world dreams forever. “Essence is truth unbound.” |

### 4–5. Extreme Purity / Corruption Endings (with Reclaimer choice)

#### Path of Mercy (Spare all three Thread Masters → Reclaimer Zone)
| Final Choice at Reclaimer | Ending Name             | Palette                | Outcome |
|---------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|---------|
| Spare Reclaimer           | White Ending – Transcendence | Pure radiant white | You sacrifice yourself. The Tapestry re-weaves without a Weaver. The cycle ends in hope and light. |
| Absorb Reclaimer          | Shattered Ending – Overreach (bad) | Brief rainbow explosion → black screen | Greed overwhelms you. The Reclaimer’s power is too much — you shatter and die instantly. |

#### Path of Corruption (Absorb all three Thread Masters → Reclaimer Zone)
| Final Choice at Reclaimer | Ending Name             | Palette                | Outcome |
|---------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|---------|
| Absorb Reclaimer          | Black Ending – The Devourer | Pure black with glowing cracks | You consume everything. Become an empty void-god. Silence falls forever. |
| Spare Reclaimer           | Hollow Ending – Drained (bad) | Dull, lifeless white | Mercy is seen as weakness. The Reclaimer steals every color from you. The world collapses into ash. |

### 6–9. Hybrid Endings (Absorb exactly two, spare one → fight Weaver normally)
The Follower steps in as the new Weaver. You fade, leaving a changed world.

| Absorbed Colors | Ending Name & Flavor |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| Red + Blue      | Purple – Tyrannical Harmony |
| Red + Yellow    | Orange – Burning Enlightenment |
| Blue + Yellow   | Teal – Illusory Peace |
| Any two         | The Follower takes the loom. “Where one thread frayed, another took its place.” Palette = beautiful hybrid of the two absorbed colors. |

### 10. Mixed / Standard Weaver Ending (Any other combination — absorb one or two but not consistent)
You fight and defeat the Weaver in the ruins of the Grand Loom. The outcome is nuanced — neither perfect restoration nor total domination. The world limps on, forever changed by your mixed choices.

Palette = whatever unique blend you created.  
Narration acknowledges both your mercy and your greed.
