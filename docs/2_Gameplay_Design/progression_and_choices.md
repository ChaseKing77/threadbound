# Progression & Player Choices

- **Starting Choice**: In the Chamber of the First Weave, choose your soul thread (Red, Blue, Yellow). This sets your permanent weapon, base cloth style (unpowered), and starting color palette bias.
- **Forced First Boss**: Your own color's Thread Master (narrative mirror moment).
- **Three Nonlinear Regions**: Tackle in any order after first boss.
- **Boss Decision** (per Thread Master):
  | Choice | Mechanical Reward | Visual/Narrative Impact |
  |--------|-------------------|-------------------------|
  | **Spare** | Permanent passive Blessing (stackable stats) | Global desaturation (+0.25 toward white), world hopeful, NPCs aid you, Weaver fight harder |
  | **Absorb** | Unlock that Master's 3 equippable tools (pick 1 per slot) | +0.5 to that color channel (RGB mix), glowing runes in your *starting color* on new cloth, world fears you, Weaver fight easier |

- **Equipment Slots**: 3 slots (Gloves/Boots/Chest-Head). Style from the Master's archetype, color from your palette.
- **Endgame**: Absorb all → Reclaimers' Area → Ruins of Grand Loom → Weaver. Ending visuals/narrative match your final palette.
