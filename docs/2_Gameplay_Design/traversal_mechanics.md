# Traversal Mechanics (Core Loop)

All movement revolves around the thread motif.

### Red Thread – Power / Unraveling
- Charge Jump & Charge Dash (momentum-based)  
- Reverse Grapple: Pulls objects/environments toward you (move platforms, rip open walls)  
- Unravel walls wrapped in red threads → shortcuts or collapsing paths

### Blue Thread – Balance / Connection
- Floaty jump + slow-fall silk drift  
- Classic thread swing/grapple on needle points (pendulum momentum chaining)  
- Mend gaps with temporary thread bridges

### Yellow Thread – Essence / Manifestation
- Double jump = manifest temporary foothold (any direction)  
- Short teleport / clone decoy for redirection  
- Phase briefly through illusionary walls

Hybrid colors unlock combined moves (e.g., Red + Yellow = explosive teleport dash).
