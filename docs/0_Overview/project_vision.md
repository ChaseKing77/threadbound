# Project Vision

Threadbound is a 2D Metroidvania with light roguelite elements built in Godot 4.

You are the last free thread in a world where fate was literally woven. Three primordial threads once dictated everything — until the Weaver shattered the loom to end predestination.

You choose your starting color, explore nonlinear regions ruled by the Thread Masters (Monarch, Hermit, Sage), and decide whether to spare or absorb them. Every choice reshapes abilities, narrative, and endings.

Tone: Melancholic, hopeful, painterly — Hollow Knight atmosphere meets Journey's emotional weight, with subtle Christian themes of creation, rebellion, and redemption woven throughout (never preached).
