# Story Outline

1. Opening cinematic – scrolling tapestry shows history → Weaver shatters the loom → one thread falls  
2. Player awakens in the Chamber of the First Weave (starting area)  
3. Choose starting thread color → defines starting abilities + narrative flavor  
4. Explore three nonlinear regions in any order  
5. Defeat each Thread Master:  
   - Spare → they live, world reacts positively later  
   - Absorb → gain secondary color powers, world becomes darker  
6. Optional Reclaimers’ Area (lose your thread temporarily, extreme challenge)  
7. Return to the ruined Grand Loom (final area)  
8. Confront the Weaver  
9. One of 8+ endings based on starting color + spare/absorb choices
