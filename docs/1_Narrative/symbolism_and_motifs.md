# Symbolism & Motifs

- Tapestry = Predestination / God’s plan  
- Shattering the loom = Rebellion against fate (Luciferian / human free will)  
- Absorption = Corruption through power  
- Sparing = Grace, mercy, redemption  
- Reclaimers = Legalism / blind obedience  
- The Mysterious Follower = Prophet / conscience / tempter figure  
- Weaving yourself = Becoming the new Creator (or destroying the need for one)

The game never preaches — these ideas are shown through environment, dialogue, and endings.
