# The Threadborne (Player Character)

You are the last unbound thread — born from the destruction of the Grand Tapestry.

- Starts as a silent, black-silhouette humanoid wrapped in faint cloth  
- No fixed color until the player chooses Red, Blue, or Yellow at the beginning  
- Visual design evolves based on absorbed threads (e.g., purple cloak for Red+Blue)  
- Silent protagonist — story told through action, environment, and the Mysterious Follower’s commentary
