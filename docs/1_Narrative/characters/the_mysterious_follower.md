# The Mysterious Follower (Hornet-style NPC)

A sharp-tongued, recurring NPC that appears throughout the journey 

- Wields a weaving staff or loom-harp weapon  
- Knows far more than they should — possibly a former apprentice of the Weaver (Or the original weaver or left their post to experience the world first hand instead of 'dictate' fate)   
- Taunts, helps, or warns the player depending on choices  
- In extreme endings (spare all OR absorb all) becomes a secret superboss  
- Represents the player’s conscience / temptation
