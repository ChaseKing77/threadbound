# Lore Overview

Long ago, the world of Aetheria was held together by the Grand Tapestry — a living weave of three primordial threads:

- Red Thread of Power  
- Blue Thread of Balance (sometimes called Fate)  
- Yellow Thread of Essence (life force, memory, spirit)

The Weaver sat at the Grand Loom and maintained destiny itself. In an act of rebellion against predestination, the Weaver shattered the loom. Magic began to fade, society fractured, and most beings lost their connection to the threads.

From the wreckage fell one final thread — uncolored and unbound. It incarnated as you: the **Threadborne**.

Three Thread Masters now rule the remnants of the world. Strange Reclaimers (silkworm-like creatures) devour loose threads to “repair” reality. Your choices will decide whether fate is restored, destroyed, or rewritten forever.
