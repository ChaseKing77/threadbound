# Threadbound 🧵

![Title Art](docs/assets/concept_art/title_stained_glass.png)

**A painterly 2D Metroidvania about threads, destiny, and the freedom to choose.**

> “In 
> the beginning, all things were woven. Every life, every choice, a thread in the Grand Tapestry.”

When the Weaver shattered the loom of creation, the world’s fate unraveled.  
From the fragments fell one final thread — and became **you**, the Threadborne.

### Core Pillars
- Three primordial threads: Red (Power) · Blue (Balance) · Yellow (Essence)
- Nonlinear Metroidvania exploration
- Choice-driven progression: spare or absorb the three Thread Masters
- 8+ endings ranging from restoration to total destruction
- Subtle Christian themes of creation, rebellion, and redemption
